What this repo provides
- A message bus core implemented with Swift actors.
- Type-safe messages using generics and protocols.
- Non-blocking async/await delivery.
- Request-response and fire-and-forget semantics.
- Simple routing with topics and metadata.
- Integration helpers for clean architecture and CQRS.

Core concepts

Message
- A message carries typed payloads.
- Messages conform to Message protocol.
- The bus validates types at compile time.

Handler
- A handler receives messages for a given message type or topic.
- Handlers run inside actors. This ensures isolated state and predictable concurrency.

Publisher
- Publishers send or forward messages to the bus.
- Publishers use async/await and can await a response.

Topic
- Topics group related messages.
- Topics act like channels in Pub/Sub.

Command vs Event
- Command: a directive that expects some action.
- Event: a fact that informs other components.

Transport
- The in-process transport is the primary runtime.
- Add custom transports to wire across processes or networks.

Key features
- Actor-based concurrency for safe mutable state.
- Type safety via protocols and generics.
- Async/await-first API.
- Minimal runtime overhead.
- Pluggable serialization and transport.
- SPM-native package and pinnings.
- Test helpers and deterministic execution paths.
- Designed for clean architecture and CQRS patterns.

Example usage

Define messages

```swift
import SwiftMessageBus
import Foundation

struct UserCreated: Message {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let createdAt: Date
}

struct GetUser: RequestMessage {
    let id: UUID
}

struct UserDTO: Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
}
```

Publisher and subscriber

```swift
actor UserRepository {
    private var storage: [UUID: UserDTO] = [:]

    func save(_ user: UserDTO) {
        storage[user.id] = user
    }

    func find(_ id: UUID) -> UserDTO? {
        storage[id]
    }
}

@main
struct Main {
    static func main() async {
        let bus = MessageBus()

        let repo = UserRepository()

        // Subscribe to events
        try await bus.subscribe(UserCreated.self) { event in
            await repo.save(UserDTO(id: event.id, name: event.name))
        }

        // Subscribe to requests
        try await bus.handleRequest(GetUser.self) { request -> UserDTO? in
            await repo.find(request.id)
        }

        // Publish an event
        let userId = UUID()
        try await bus.publish(UserCreated(id: userId, name: "Jane", createdAt: Date()))

        // Send a request and await response
        if let dto = try await bus.request(GetUser(id: userId)) {
            print("User:", dto.name)
        }
    }
}
```

Actor-based handlers

- Handlers run inside actors by default when they need isolated state.
- You can define actor handlers to ensure no shared mutable state escapes.

```swift
actor NotificationHandler {
    func handle(_ event: UserCreated) async {
        // prepare push or analytics
    }
}

let notifications = NotificationHandler()
try await bus.subscribe(UserCreated.self) { event in
    await notifications.handle(event)
}
```

Request/Response and Commands/Events (CQRS)

- Use RequestMessage for request/response flows.
- Use CommandMessage for actions that may mutate state.
- Use Event for facts.

```swift
protocol CommandMessage: Message {}
protocol EventMessage: Message {}

struct CreateUserCommand: CommandMessage {
    let name: String
}

try await bus.send(CreateUserCommand(name: "Taylor"))
try await bus.publish(UserCreated(id: UUID(), name: "Taylor", createdAt: Date()))
```

Integration patterns

Clean architecture

- Keep the bus on the boundary layer or in a shared kernel.
- Use ports and adapters to connect domain services to handlers.
- Commands and events live in domain contracts to preserve type safety.

Example structure
- Domain: Messages, DTOs, domain interfaces
- Application: Use cases, command handlers
- Infrastructure: Message bus wiring, transports, persistence

Event sourcing hook

- Attach an event store adapter to the bus.
- Persist events as they flow.
- Offer replay by re-publishing stored events.

Cross-platform setup (iOS / macOS)

- The same package runs on iOS and macOS.
- Keep UI concerns out of handler logic.
- Use async/await from SwiftUI views to publish commands.

Advanced usage

Priorities and backpressure

- The bus supports prioritization flags on messages.
- Use priority for urgent messages like system events.

Example:

```swift
let options = PublishOptions(priority: .high)
try await bus.publish(UserCreated(...), options: options)
```

Backpressure model
- The bus applies per-handler queues.
- If queue fills, the bus applies backpressure strategies:
  - dropOldest
  - dropNewest
  - blockUntilAvailable

Routing and topic namespaces

- Define topics as string namespaces or typed topics.
- Use topic filters to subscribe to subsets of events.

Example:

```swift
let topic = Topic("users.created")
try await bus.subscribe(topic, UserCreated.self) { event in
    // handle
}
```

Serialization and persistence

- The core uses in-memory transport with typed delivery.
- Add a JSON serializer for cross-process transport.
- Implement a Transport protocol to persist or send over network.

Transport protocol (conceptual)

```swift
protocol Transport {
    func send<DataType: Codable>(_ message: DataType, topic: String) async throws
    func receive(topic: String, handler: @escaping (Data) async throws -> Void) async
}
```

Testing and mocks

- The package provides test helpers to run handlers synchronously.
- Use in-memory bus to assert message flow deterministically.

Example test

```swift
func testCreateUserFlows() async throws {
    let bus = InMemoryMessageBus()
    var received = [UserCreated]()
    try await bus.subscribe(UserCreated.self) { event in
        received.append(event)
    }

    try await bus.publish(UserCreated(id: UUID(), name: "Alex", createdAt: Date()))

    XCTAssertEqual(received.count, 1)
}
```

Performance notes

- The design minimizes heap allocations for routing.
- Actors reduce locking overhead.
- The bus batches some deliveries under high load.
- Benchmarks in the repo compare delivery latency with and without batching.

Sample benchmark results (local)
- Single-threaded deliver: ~1.2 Âµs/msg
- Concurrent actors, 1000 handlers: ~4.6 Âµs/msg
- Request/response roundtrip (in-process): ~10 Âµs

These numbers vary by hardware and OS. Use the included benchmark tools to reproduce results.

API reference (selected)

MessageBus main API

```swift
public final class MessageBus {
    public init(configuration: BusConfiguration = .default)
    public func subscribe<M: Message>(_ type: M.Type, handler: @escaping (M) async -> Void) async throws
    public func handleRequest<Req: RequestMessage, Res>(_ type: Req.Type, handler: @escaping (Req) async -> Res?) async throws
    public func publish<M: Message>(_ message: M, options: PublishOptions = .default) async throws
    public func request<Req: RequestMessage, Res>(_ request: Req, timeout: Duration? = nil) async throws -> Res?
    public func addTransport(_ transport: Transport)
}
```

Handler options

- queueLimit: Int
- actorIsolation: ActorPolicy (useActor, copy, none)
- retryPolicy: RetryPolicy

Troubleshooting

- If handlers do not receive messages:
  - Check that the type used in subscribe exactly matches the type used in publish.
  - Ensure the bus instance is the same or registered transport bridges messages.
  - Verify actor lifetimes. Keep handlers reachable.

- If request hangs:
  - Provide a timeout on request().
  - Confirm a request handler exists for the request type.

Developer guide (detailed)

Design goals
- Predictable concurrency via actors.
- Strong type safety for message contracts.
- Small runtime and simple dependency graph.
- Clear separation between domain and infrastructure.

Message contract patterns
- Keep messages small and serializable.
- Keep versioning in mind. Add a message version field if events will be stored.

Backwards-compatibility tips
- Add new fields as optional.
- Create mappers for old event shapes.
- Keep handler code tolerant of missing fields.

Error handling
- Handlers can throw.
- Use a retry policy for transient failures.
- Use a dead-letter queue by attaching a transport that persists failures.

Observability and tracing
- The bus emits lifecycle events for publish, deliver, and ack.
- Attach a tracer that records timestamps and handler ids.
- Correlate messages with a trace id in metadata.

Example: add trace id metadata

```swift
var metadata = MessageMetadata()
metadata[.traceId] = UUID().uuidString
try await bus.publish(event, metadata: metadata)
```

Schema evolution
- Keep schemas in domain contracts folder.
- Use codable with custom keys to map names across versions.

Testing patterns

Unit tests
- Use InMemoryMessageBus to keep tests fast.
- Use async test expectations tied to message reception.

Integration tests
- Use docker or local binaries from releases for multi-process tests.
- The released CLI includes a test runner to spin up multiple nodes locally.

Benchmarking
- Use swiftmessagebus-bench from releases.
- Run with various handler counts and message sizes.
- Use system tools to profile hotspots.

Example benchmark command

```bash
./swiftmessagebus-bench --handlers 100 --messages 100000 --payload-size 128
```

Diagnostics
- Use the built-in diagnostics reporter for queue lengths, handler latencies, and failures.
- Export metrics to Prometheus via adapter.

Practical tips

- Keep message contracts in a shared package when multiple services exchange events.
- Avoid heavy payloads in events. Prefer IDs and let consumers fetch details.
- Use request/response for synchronous needs and events for eventual consistency.
- Use actors for stateful handlers that require isolation.

Frequently asked questions

Q: Does the bus work across processes?
A: The core is in-process. Add a transport adapter for cross-process or networked delivery.

Q: Will handlers run in parallel?
A: Yes. Handlers run concurrently when they are on different actors or subscribers.

Q: How do I handle long-running work?
A: Offload long tasks to dedicated worker actors or background tasks. Keep handler code responsive.

Q: Can I route messages by metadata?
A: Yes. Use routing policies and custom selectors to filter by headers or metadata.

Q: Is there a GUI or dashboard?
A: The repo contains CLI tools in releases. The roadmap includes a web dashboard.
